            The Queen City of the Hudson, Poughkeepsie, New York, is a small suburban city in the Historic Hudson Valley Region.
             It is located halfway between New York City and the State Capitol, Albany. The City initially settled by the Dutch 
             was known for its whale rendering and shipping of goods and eventually beacame a manufacturing and commercial hub.

            After years of neglect and decay, the City is now entering a resurgence of interest. New Businesses and residents 
            have been moving into the City for its natural beauty and proximity to New York City.
